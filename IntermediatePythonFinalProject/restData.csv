ALLA FAMIGLIA,ITALIAN,4124881440,"Alla Famiglia remains a favorite among members of the independent Restaurant Review Panel for its bountiful portions, crisp service and white-tablecloth dining that suggests a dressed-up evening. Jonathan C. Vlasic expanded his 13-year-old restaurant this year into the adjacent building, adding an upscale dining room and bar. The house specialty is a double-cut veal chop, and that’s exactly what you should get. It comes in a variety of permutations such as grilled Florentine style with lemon and rosemary jus and pizzaiola, a braised preparation with marinara, hot and sweet peppers, sausage, onions and fontina, caramelized on the outside and tender within.",False
B52 CAFE,MIDDLE EASTERN,4127815204,"Omar Abuhejleh’s Upper Lawrenceville establishment is a restaurant with flavorful, Levantine-influenced vegan cuisine that also serves as a soulful community cafe. Start your day with a specialty coffee or a bracing shot of espresso while enjoying avocado or almond butter toast on house-baked bread; the buckwheat sourdough pancakes are another excellent option. For a healthy and satisfying lunch, begin your meal with a selection of mezze such as best-in-town baba ganouj and labneh made from fermented cashews, crush a za’atar flatbread and dig into a falafel salad.",False
BAR MARCO,MEDITERRANEAN,4124711900,"Bar Marco has been my touchstone Pittsburgh restaurant since it opened in 2012 in the Strip District.

BITTER ENDS GARDEN & LUNCHEONETTE,AMERICAN,4124500229,"Combine the best aspects of the farm-to-table movement with an old-school neighborhood lunch counter, and you have Bitter Ends Garden &amp; Luncheonette. The restaurant, which seats 17, might be pocket-sized, yet Chef/Co-Owner Becca Hegarty makes magic with what she serves on her curated, vegetable-forward menu that also features house-baked breads and pastries. Hegarty and her partners pay fastidious attention to quality of ingredient, farming some of what’s cooked and teaming up with other regional producers for the rest. Saddle up to the counter for a killer sausage and egg breakfast sandwich, a vegetable hoagie or a bowl of soup. Or, all of them … and a doughnut.",False
CAFE ZINHO,MEDITERRANEAN,4123631500,"There are few Pittsburgh meals that are more transportive than sharing an al fresco dinner with a group of friends at Cafe Zinho in Shadyside.

COCOTHE,NEW AMERICAN,4122598847,"There perhaps is no restaurant in Pittsburgh which is as darling an upscale hidden gem as Cocothé in Sewickley, where Executive Chef Dave DeVoss crafts forward-thinking dishes inspired by Continental dining tradition. His seasonal menus include appetizers such as beef tartare with port wine poached pear, radicchio salad and cranberry and hazelnut crackers as well as entrees such as roasted salmon with apple and lemon smashed potatoes, beurre blanc sauce and shaved apple and fennel salad.

CURE,MEDITERRANEAN,4122522595,"Executive Chef/Co-Owner Justin Severino, chef de cuisine Danielle Felix and the rest of the culinary team at Cure consistently craft some of Pittsburgh’s most exciting dishes. Coddled eggs with sherry chantilly and smoked maple, for example, is elegant comfort in a calcium shell, and roasted trout with braised swiss chard, calabrian chili, crispy fried white runner beans and burnt lemon hits the mark as an elevated yet unfussy main course. Pasta dishes, available by the half- and whole-order, work as a side dish, a main course and even, paired with a glass of wine or one of Cure’s perfectly balanced cocktails, an indulgent snack.",False
DIANOIAS EATERY,ITALIAN,4129181875,"DiAnoia’s Eatery seamlessly bridges the divide between wildly popular, Instagramable (and also flavorsome) dishes such as Sorrentina-style gnocchi, which comes in its own bread bowl, with rooted Italian cuisine such as porchetta served with its drippings and olive-oil-kissed, pan-roasted branzino served with roasted potatoes and tomatoes.

DINETTE,MEDITERRANEAN,4123620202,"Dinette remains as relevant and vital a force in Pittsburgh dining as when Sonja J Finn opened it in 2008.

DRIFTWOOD OVEN,PIZZA,4122510253,"Pittsburgh went ga-ga when author/model Chrissy Teigen tweeted in February about how much she loved Driftwood Oven.

Brent Peyton currently is the establishment’s executive chef and his menu leans toward classic dishes such as rosemary-cranberry crusted elk and braised beef short ribs but also includes lentil stew with Wagyu beef cheek and winter vegetable flan.

LEGUME,AMERICAN,4126212700,"Trevett Hooper’s Legume restaurant won early acclaim with progressive eaters when he opened the first iteration of the producer-to-table eatery in 2007, and he reached a wider audience moving to Oakland in 2011. This year, Legume’s reputation for responsive seasonal cuisine and genuine connection to local food systems hit the national spotlight, earning a James Beard award semifinalist nod for Best Restaurant (Hooper also was a 2013 Best Chef: Mid-Atlantic semifinalist).

NOODLEHEAD,THAI,4122357828,"Quick and casual is the name of the game at Noodlehead. All of the noodle recipes on the restaurant’s modest menu were created or inspired by Tongdee family matriarch Pusadee Tongdee. With a name like Noodlehead, it’s not much of a surprise that noodles are what you want to get at this cash-only, BYOB restaurant. Standout dishes include chiang mai curry (egg noodles, chicken, pickled mustard greens, crispy shallots, yellow curry coconut milk sauce) and kee mao (big flat rice noodles, bok choy, napa cabbage, spicy chili garlic sauce); the noodle soups are solid, too.",False

PENN AVENUE FISH COMPANY,SEAFOOD,4124347200,"Penn Avenue Fish Company merges a vibrant fish market with a casual, BYOB eatery. Deep inside the space is a sushi counter, where chefs craft nigiri bites with fresh fish lofted atop seasoned rice served at body temperature.

PICCOLO FORNO,ITALIAN,4126220111,"In 2005, long before Lawrenceville became a booming hotspot, third-generation Pittsburgh restaurateur Domenic Branduzzi started serving pizza, pasta and more at Piccolo Forno.

SALEMS MARKET & GRILL,MIDDLE EASTERN,4122357828,I love the lunchtime hubbub at Salem’s Market &amp; Grill. Come prepared for bare-bones ambience and amenities that are balanced by warm hospitality and fantastic food.

SENTI,ITALIAN,4125864347,"Senti’s low-key exterior makes it easy to miss, which is a shame because once you’re inside, it’s a real treat. Pittsburgh is lucky to have owner Franco Braccia running front-of-house service; his ability to read and react to what a table needs is extraordinary.",True
SMOKE BARBEQUE TAQUERIA,BARBEQUE,4122242070,"Pittsburgh doesn’t have many terrific taco options, which is why we love this hybrid barbecue-taco shop. Executive Chef/Co-Owner Jeff Petruso does a fantastic job of mashing up Texas-style barbecue with Austin taco culture at SMOKE Barbeque Taqueria in Lawrenceville. He prepares tantalizing smoked meats such as brisket, ribs and pork shoulder that are served in house-made flour; freshly made corn tortillas also are available. Look for daily specials, too.

SPORK,AMERICAN,4124411700,Executive Chef Christian Frangiadis sat at the pinnacle of Pittsburgh dining in the late 1990s. After more than a decade in the Caribbean — and a few years finding his footing at Spork — he’s climbed back to the top of the peak.,False
STAGIONI,ITALIAN,4125864738,"Stagioni is either a beloved part of your regular restaurant rotation or one of Pittsburgh’s best kept secrets.

TAIWANESE BISTRO CAFE 33,TAIWANESE,4124212717,"Regionally specific Chinese cuisine is on the rise in Pittsburgh, and there perhaps is no better demonstration of this trend than Taiwanese Bistro Cafe 33. Executive Chef/Co-Owner Asan Tao forgoes generic “Chinese food” in favor of a menu of Taiwanese specialties such as cold jellyfish, three-cup chicken and pork with mustard greens soup. Certain dishes, such as pork-blood “tofu” with garlic-chive soup, intestines in garlic sauce and book-tripe with vegetables, might be unfamiliar to Western palettes but absolutely are worth ordering.

TESSAROS AMERICAN BAR & HARDWOOD GRILL,BURGERS/AMERICAN,4126826809,"Pittsburghers have since 1981 flocked to the Bloomfield burger joint and bar for a taste of a true Steel City classic. Every day, Tessaro’s butcher Dominic Piccola grinds the restaurant’s custom blend of chuck, brisket, short rib, New York strip and other cuts. Then, grill master Courtney McFarlane cooks the ground beef over a hardwood fire, as he’s done nearly every day since 1992. As any regular would tell you, there are no French fries at Tessaro’s; instead order a favorite side such as boiled red-skin potatoes or broccoli (hey, your body will thank you). On Thursdays, there is a ribs special. We love the bar — and the longstanding bartenders — at Tessaro’s too.",False
THE CAFE CARNEGIE,AMERICAN,4126223225,"Cafe Carnegie is one of my favorite lunch destinations in Pittsburgh. The upscale yet casual restaurant is nestled in the lobby of The Carnegie Museums of Art and Natural History, which means a quick cultural escape is footsteps away. One of the things I love best about Consulting Chef Sonja J Finn’s menu is that a meal will leave you feeling stronger and more energetic than when you came in. Go for peppy, satisfying salads such as the Zuni Cafe-influenced pulled chicken salad or salad chevre chaud, or a heartier dish such as Jamison Farm lamb pot pie.",True
THE TWISTED FRENCHMAN,MODERN FRENCH,4126652880,"In 2017, Executive Chef/Partner Andrew Garbarino moved The Twisted Frenchman restaurant down the block into a multimillion-dollar remodel of an old auction house.

He and his kitchen team prepare 3-, 8- and 14-course tasting menus, as well as a 21-course chef’s table experience. Garbarino focuses on high-quality ingredients and uses both classic French and modernist techniques in his preparations. Service is top-notch, as is the wine list.",True
THE VANDAL,AMERICAN,4122510465,"It’s marvelous witnessing a restaurant metamorphosize into a new stage of maturity. The Vandal remains as hip as when it was included on Pittsburgh Magazine’s 2016 Best Restaurants list — and the chicken sandwich and hamburger still are draws. Even better — the addition of a refined dinner menu, table service and an upgraded design makes the restaurant now as much an evening destination as it is a lunch and brunch spot. Look to dishes such as green borscht with potato, dill and cured egg and stuffed quail with paprikash, spaetzle and cucumber, where Executive Chef Csilla Thackray draws from her Hungarian heritage.",False
UDIPI CAFE,INDIAN,4123735581,"2018 might mark Udipi Cafe’s first year on Pittsburgh Magazine’s Best Restaurants list, yet savvy diners have known since 1996 that Manjunath Sherigar’s restaurant is home to the region’s best vegan southern Indian cuisine. Look past the bare-bones decor and treat your taste buds to invigorating dishes such as avial (vegetables cooked in coconut sauce and spice) and kadhi bhindi curry (Okra with herbs and spices). The restaurant’s dosas — thin pancakes made from fermented rice and lentil flours, stuffed with ingredients such as spiced potato, onion and chutney — are a draw.",False
UMAMI,JAPANESE,4122242354,"Pittsburgh is a city starving for late-night dining options. One of the reasons we love Umami, a third-floor izakaya from Roger Li (Ki Ramen, Ki Pollo) and Derek Brunell (Round Corner Cantina) is that the establishment serves crushable Japanese pub food such as chawanmushi, karaage and okonomiyaki until midnight during the week and 2 a.m. on weekends. Li and his team also serve some of the best sushi in Pittsburgh — pay particular attention to the daily specials. We’re smitten with items such as whole fish, King Trumpet mushroom and bacon-quail eggs cooked on the charcoal-fired robata grill. The izakaya’s intricate design and DJ-curated playlists are transportive.",True
UMI JAPANESE RESTAURANT,JAPANESE,4123626198,"Umi is a trailblazing Pittsburgh restaurant. The nearly 20-year-old establishment became a sushi destination long before there were any options of its caliber in Pittsburgh, and it remains on top of the seasoned rice pile. Executive Chef Mr. Shu’s handiwork is beloved by everyone from Pittsburgh’s professional athletes, visiting film stars and an array of regulars.

UNION STANDARD,AMERICAN,4122810738,"Derek Stevens made his mark in Pittsburgh as the longstanding executive chef of Eleven, running the Strip District kitchen for more than a decade.

Stevens’ menu marries the cuisines of the Mid-Atlantic, Appalachia and the Northeast with impeccably sourced dishes such as Jamison Farm lamb with Anson Mills polenta, blistered green beans, blood orange and pistachio and Laurel Hill trout with fingerling potato, smoked jalapeno and chow chow.

VIVO KITCHEN,MEDITERRANEAN,4122598945,"Vivo is a rare restaurant that primarily is a neighborhood favorite, yet, also is worthy as a destination dinner. The family-run business — Sam DiBattista is the restaurant’s executive chef and his wife, Lori, runs front-of-house operations — radiates warmth from greeting to goodbye. Roasted chicken is de rigueur this year in Pittsburgh, but cooking a whole, crispy bird is something DiBattista perfected years ago.
