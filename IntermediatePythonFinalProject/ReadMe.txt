Program Description
--------------------------------------------
Yinz Hungry is a curated restaurant search program designed to help hangry and indecisive Pittsburghers find the best place to eat. Data is sourced from two years of Pittsburgh Magazine’s Best Restaurants list (2019 and 2018). Users select a cuisine type to receive a curated list of best restaurants of that cuisine type. From this list, the user selects their restaurant and can retrieve additional information on the restaurant’s phone number, address, directions, reviews, and health inspection history. Finally, users who want to eat something with fries can use the FrySearch to get a list of all Primanti Brothers locations in Allegheny County. Yinz Hungry’s target users include foodies, travelers visiting Pittsburgh, and fry-lovers.
